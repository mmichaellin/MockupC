        According to a recent animal study published in the European Journal of
        Lipid Science and Technology, the answer is yes!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Here's how:</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Scientists have discovered keeping your blood sugar healthy boils down
        to a simple enzyme in your body.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>If this enzyme is shut down, that leads to...</p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        ✔️ <i>Concerning <b>insulin levels</b>...</i>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        ✔️ <i>Struggling to keep your <b>HbA1c</b> in the normal range...</i>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        ✔️
        <i>Or frustration with your <b>belly fat</b> and <b>fatigue</b>...</i>
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>On the other hand, if this enzyme is active in your body...</p>
      <br />
    </div>
    <div class="bg-img-2">
      <h1>You can have PERFECT blood sugar, every time you check...</h1>
      <p><i>You'll marvel at your steady, low, natural insulin levels...</i></p>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar-container">
      <img src="./assets/doctor.png" />
      <div class="sidebar">
        <p>
          You might even get a thumbs up from your doctor, after confirming your
          HbA1c is the best it's been in years
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          And also hear from your doctor that whatever you've been doing to lose
          those extra points:
          <i>"Keep it up, because it's working like crazy!"</i>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>So what does this have to do with eating chocolate?</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Simple... it turns out you can activate this enzyme by eating chocolate!
        Seriously!
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        If you're skeptical, I completely understand.
        <b>And why wouldn't you be?</b>
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        After all, if you're concerned about your blood sugar... everyone out
        there is telling you something different...
      </p>
      <br /><br />
    </div>
    <div class="bg-img-3">
      <div class="container">
        <br />
        <h1>You CAN now switch it back on</h1>
        <br /><br />
        <p>Even if you're tired, out of shape, and have poor eating habits.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Your age doesn't matter, either.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          And when you do flip your AMPK on, you won't believe the results...
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can keep your blood sugar healthy and stay sensitive to your
          natural insulin... so you can feel steady energy, look thin and
          trim...
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ...and stop stressing... because you know your numbers are in the
          normal range.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>And the most incredible part is, it's simpler than you think.</p>
        <br />
        <p>You can do this right in the comfort of your own home...</p>
